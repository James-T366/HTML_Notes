public class
  //signals to the JVM that the class is accessible from any other class, regardless of the package it belongs to
public static void main(String[] args){}
  //access specifier, keyword, return type, method name, array of string type
import java.util.Scanner;
  //A Scanner is a text parser that can get numbers, words, or phrases from an input source
Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
  //Create a scanner object with this statement and gets system input
scnr.nextInt();
  //Get next input
scnr.nextLine()
	//Gets input of whole line (does not skip leading white space while scnr.next() does)
double 
  // float but holds bigger numbers
float
	//is typically only used in memory-saving situations, as discussed below for short
System.out.print & System.out.println
  // puts text to output
char 
  // holds a character using ''
Java does not have a method for getting one character from input. Instead, the following sequence can be used: myChar = scnr.next().charAt(0); The charAt(0) is explained in another section. 
Briefly, next() gets the next sequence of non-whitespace characters (as a string), and charAt(0) gets the first character in that string.
boolean
  // has to be declared
int
  //integer
long
	//long is used for integers expected to exceed about 2 billion.
short
	// rarely used but holds upto 16 bits
switch 
  //control structure that allows you to execute different parts of code based on the value of a variable. It provides a more readable and organized way to handle multiple conditions compared to using a series of if-else
break
  // exit block of code
this 
  //keyword used to refer to the current object instance within a class
return 
  // finishes the execution of a method and can be used to return a value from a method
System.out.printf("%.2f", myFloat);
	//The syntax for outputting the double myFloat with two digits after the decimal point is
final 
	// will ouput an error if keyword final is put before variable and later in the program that varioable is changed (contsant variable)
	//it is good practice to capitalize constat variables
Math.sqrt() 
Math.pow(x,y)
Math.abs()

randNum && randNum % 
// generates random number and a random number within a certain range

import java.util.Random;
 //enables use of the Random class.
Random randGen = new Random();
	// similar to scanner

//escape sequences

\n	newline
\t	tab
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash

//reserved words
