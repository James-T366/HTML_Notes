Welcome whoever may stumbled across this repo.
The title may explain it, but I have an ambitous goal of learning/brushing up on a lot of programming languages 
and I want to use this repo for any syntax or things that are important to remember. If you have any tips or 
suggestions please reach out to me! I am always open to learn more.
